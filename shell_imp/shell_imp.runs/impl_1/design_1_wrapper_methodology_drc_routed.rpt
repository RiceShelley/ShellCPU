TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks CLK100Mhz_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and CLK100Mhz_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks CLK100Mhz_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks CLK100Mhz_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1]

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT design_1_i/clock_gen/and_gate/c_INST_0 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
